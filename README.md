# EU Detroit Bot
A chat bot for Discord.

---

Run via
```bash
node .
```

---

## Config options:

- **`token`** The Discord Bot token.
- **`prefix`** The command prefix, when a line starts with this prefix the bot will try to match a command to run.
- **`devModeGuildID`** A single specific Guild ID, which will be the only guild(server) where the bot responds when running in Dev Mode.
- **`blacklistCommands`** The command names (not aliases) to disable (will also disable all aliases). A disabled command is treated as non-existant and can't be used.
- **`hiddenCommands`** The command names (not aliases) to hide (will also hide all aliases). A hidden command can be used normally, but will not show up in the `help` command.
- **`defaultCommandCooldown`** The default cooldown for commands that don't have their own custom cooldown. Cooldowns are per-command, AND per-user.
- **`blacklistUsers`** User names who are not allowed to interact with the bot.
- **`autoP`** Toggles a special feature that automatically sanitizes messages from specific users by replacing specific characters.
- **`autoPusers`** Configures the users for whom the above autoP feature would work, if enabled.
- **`debtStart`** The (approximate) time when Djessey's debt interest started counting.
- **`jetlagMode`** Toggles a special feature that accounts for timezone differences with certain users, by reposting their messages in the appropriate time for others.
- **`adultMode`** Adult Mode enables various adult-only (ie not child-safe) features.
- **`bodyParts`** Body part names are used by fun commands, for example: "x punched y in the face".
